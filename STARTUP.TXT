The boot-manager (BOOTLDR) consists of two separate files: BOOTCDR and BOOTMBR.
Both are analogous to eachother, expect for the fact that BOOTCDR understands
ISO-9660 formatted discs, and BOOTMBR only understands MBR formatted disks.

CDROM:

After the PC-BIOS finishes its POST process, the PC-BIOS then loads the startup
file located in the CD's Boot Catalog (right now, only i386 is supported), and
transfers CPU execution to the startup file. The startup file then carries out
the following tasks:

	1. Test and, if necessary, enable the A20-line, and test the
	   PC-BIOS for interrupt extensions; otherwise, terminate startup.
	2. Relocate startup-file to higher memory.
	3. Load the BOOTLDR into lower memory, upto 640 KB.
	4. Transfer CPU execution to BOOTLDR

The A20-line is tested first to ensure that no faulty CPU is being used. If the
CPU is faulty in any way, then running an operating system is not feasible in
any way.

MBR:

The Master Boot Record (MBR) on the formatted medium consists of one entire
sector (512 bytes, typically). The MBR relocates itself to lower memory, loads
the VBR (Volume Boot Record) at logical-address 07C0:0, and transfers CPU
execution.

The VBR contains BOOTLDR (file: BOOTMBR), and is divided into two portions: the
first is loads the portion tries and enables the A20-line. After sucessful
initialization of the A20-line, CPU execution is transfered to the remaining
portion of BOOTLDR.
