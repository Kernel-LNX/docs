CDROM:

After the PC-BIOS finishes its POST process, the PC-BIOS then loads the startup
file located in the CD's Boot Catalog (right now, only i386 is supported), and
transfers CPU execution to the startup file. After this is finished, the startup
file then performs the following tasks:

	1. Alert the user of hardware configuration changes.
	2. Test for PC-BIOS interrupt 13h extensions; otherwise,
	   terminate startup.
	3. Relocate startup-file to higher memory.
	4. Loads the BOOTLDR into lower memory, upto 640 KB.
	5. Transfer CPU execution to BOOTLDR
